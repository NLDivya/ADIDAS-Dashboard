#### ADIDAS-Dashboard
#### Creating a ADIDAS Sales Dashboard using EXCEL

###### Introduction:
In this project, I have analysed ADIDAS Sales database dataset.

###### Data:
The dataset is taken from YouTube. It consists of an excel file.

The file consists of 13 columns and 9000+ rows. The fields are Retailer, Retailer ID, Invoice Date, Region, State, City, Product & Sales method.
The intercative dashboard is built based on Year, Products and Region.

###### Approach:
* Analyzed the dataset and created Pivot tables.
* Created the charts (Doughnut, Bar, Line) and map as necessary to display ADIDAS Sales.
* Created a new interactive dashboard to display Sales based on region, Method, Retailer and number of units sold. The dashboard is made dynamic by adding the below filtering options: Year, Products and Region using Slicing option.
